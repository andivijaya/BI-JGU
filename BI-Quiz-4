DATA UNDERSTANDING (13) 
Data Visualization – Histograms  
• A histogram shows the frequency distribution  for a numerical attribute. 
• The range of numerical attribute is discretized  into a fixed number of intervals (“bins”),  
usually of equal length. 
• For each interval, the (absolute) frequency of  values falling into it is indicated by the height  
of a bar. 
• The number of bins is very important.
